                <p>EZ is a company created to help empower young adults and youths in managing their personal finances. For young adults, particularly students, financial management is a challenging responsibility. Likewise, youths, along with their parents, often face difficulties in understanding the significance of saving and making informed decisions (Widener). At EZ, we believe in the power of awareness, education, and practical guidance to navigate these issues, ensuring a stable and secure financial future.</p>
                <ul>
                    <p>Our mission is to:</p>
                    <li><strong>Enhance awareness:</strong> Help both young adults and youths recognize their spending patterns and the importance of saving.</li>
                    <li><strong>Improve financial allocation:</strong> Help bettering allocation of money to prevent end-of-month liquidity problems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Promote healthy financial habits:</strong> Encourage the development of sound financial habits for our users.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Mismanagement of spendings/Overspending:</strong> For younger adults (i.e. students), it is a common issue to mismanage their spendings between each student loan deposit and get into liquidity problems at the end of each month. We want to help our customers become aware of <em>what</em> they are spending their money on, meaning they reduce the risk of overspending.</li>
                    <li><strong>Unforeseen expenses/Changes in subscription prices:</strong> Many young adults do not account for unexpected expenses or sudden price-changes in their subscriptions, causing financial instability. Through well-balanced budget allocations and real-time price scanning for subscriptions we aim to help our customers be better prepared and become quickly aware of situations like this.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lack of savings/Limited awareness about saving/Lack of financial education:</strong> A common problem is that they know they <em>should</em> be saving money, but struggle with committing to it. For others it might be that they are underestimating the long-term benefits of saving. Regardless, we want to educate and give our customers well-developed tools and strategies for their saving plans and money management.</li>
                    <li><strong>Setting and achieving financial goals:</strong> Youths may find it difficult to establish and attain realistic financial targets. In some cases, it might be the parents who want to help their son/daughter with this. Through engaging tools and resources, as well as a parental/guardian-mode, EZ will make this easier to realize.</p></li>

                <p>EZ Budgeting is a subscription based service that aims to help its users to take control over their personal finances. By providing organized overviews of what the user is spending their money on, compare and analyze their spending habits with others, as well as provide solutions based on their goals and current money habits.</p>
                <p>The product is thought to be mainly used as an application, but will also be available online. For it to function as planned, it needs to be easy to navigate and provide explanations and purpose of the different features. It also needs to be kept quite simplistic as to not overwhelm the user with information.</p>
                <p>Displayed in the image on the left is our low-fidelity prototype for the EZ Budgeting application.</p>
